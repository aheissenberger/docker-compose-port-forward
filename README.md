# Example App / Port forward with DevContainer and Docker Compose

> Change devcontainer.json to allow to forwarding ports (forwardPorts) with docker compose docker desktop or vscode cloud

You need multiple containers for your development setup and use a `docker-compose.yml` file to declare the requirements for your services. 
After starting the setup you see the port for one service in the VSCode ports tab but none of the ports from the other service containers.

This is the example code for the blog post [Port forward with DevContainer and Docker Compose fails](https://www.heissenberger.at/en/blog/devcontainer-forward-ports-composer/)
